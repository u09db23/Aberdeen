# Aberdeen


DYLAN BLACK - 52317840


I decided to go with a dark red and off-white colour as they are colours commonly seen in relation to Aberdeen. I created a simple banner for the top of each page but struggled to get the sizing and positioning correct for some time. Eventually I made my final decision and moved on to the navigation. I wanted to create a unique design to the navigation of the page to make it seem less static. I decided to add a slight colour change as well as a line that appears after hovering over each of the pages. It took me some time to get the positioning of the Nav in the correct place as at times it was under the banner and even overlapping with some of the information. After numerous trial and error attempts I finally decided on the positioning and went with dark colours so not to clash with the red of the banner. I decided to add interactive bootstrap buttons to my visit page to make the page more exiting. As well as the automatic image carousels. I faced trouble with getting the image sizing correct however after resizing some of the images I was able to make it look much better. I also had trouble with a slider showing up at the bottom of my page however I changed the sizes and padding of the images which solved the problem. I decided to keep the history page simple with large images to add context to the information provided.
