    <p class="homepara1"> "Aberdeen is a port city in northeast Scotland, where the Dee and Don rivers meet the North
        Sea. With an offshore petroleum industry, the city is home to an international population. It's also known as
        the ‘Granite City’ for its many enduring grey-stone buildings. The 19th-century Marischal College is typical – a
        monumental Victorian landmark that’s now headquarters of the City Council Aberdeen is one of the oldest cities
        in the UK, a huge urban centre in Scotland and a key piece of the UK’s national infrastructure, but a lot of
        people don’t realise how truly interesting and unique “The Silver City” really is.

        Surrounded by a national park twice the size of the Lake District, with a sea bursting with life and a heart to
        the city that reaches forward, out of the past and into a bright future, this bustling urban hub of Scottish
        life has so much to offer every student who comes here." </p>
